Having the specific documentation (which this site also has) is good, but having guides on how to actually use the sensors is better. For example, many phones have a barometer which is used 
to get air pressure, which in turn can be used to figure out elevation. Other sensors may have similar not-immediately-obvious uses.

There is a lot of information on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation"> whole site</a>, and while that means there are a lot of ways to 
interface with a phone, the entire site is overwhelming. This link takes you to an overview of how to use motion (acceleration, rotation), 
step-counter, the magnetic field sensor and the barometer.

This is a collection of APIs. Some are fun/bizzare, like the one that gets pictures of cats, but this also includes WolframAlpha, Nasa, and Noaa climate data among others.
